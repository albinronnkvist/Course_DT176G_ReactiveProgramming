# DT176G - Reactive Programming

The reactive programming paradigm with RxJava.

This course covered reactive programming with RxJava and functional programming concepts, with a particular focus on the Streams API. For the final project, I developed a [contextual chatbot](https://github.com/albinronnkvist/Course_DT176G_ReactiveProgramming/tree/main/Project) using RxJava and Swing, applying reactive and functional principles to create dynamic, interactive, and context-aware responses.
